# Fashion-MNIST-Data-classification

The Fashion MNIST Classification Project involves building and training a machine learning model to classify images of clothing items into one of ten categories. 

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels, with 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing. 

This project aims to demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques for image classification tasks.

Real time example can be seen in online shopping websites.
